       Ask the user to enter the day as in M, T, W, H, F, A, U respectively for the days of the week.
       These are characters
       
       Ask the user to enter the price of the item they want to buy. 
       This is a double
       
       Depending on what day it is, The discount on the item is either 5,10,15,20 or 25
       for the days Monday to Friday and if Saturday or Sunday, output something along the lines of
       "either you're lying or a thief because the store is supposed to be closed".
       
       Then ask the user if they are a graduating senior and from PV or a previous employee. The answer is Y or N. (char)
       if yes, apply an extra 5% discount. If they are a graduating senior from Bettendorf, add 5% to their cost.
       If they are not a graduating senior process usually.
       
       Rules
       1. Have variable names that make sense
       2. Follow one convention systematically. If your brackets start on the next line as mine do, Do not change that
       3. Try to make the code as concise as possible. Not the least line numbers but logically, as simple as it can be
       4. Make the program funny or sarcastic bc why not.
