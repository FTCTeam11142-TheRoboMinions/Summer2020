/**
 *  This challenge is based on Day 10 and Day 11 Tutorials. Watch both.
 *
 *  This week you shall have two challenges
 *
 *  Level 1
 *      Make a cashier app with two different classes. A utility class with all the functions and methods
 *      and call all of those functions and methods from a different class. This is based on Challenge 6
 *      Only one of your classes can have a main method and it should perform all the functions (HAHA)
 *      that Challenge 6 mentions.
 *
 *  Level 2 This is a hard challenge so give it some time
 *
 *      Make a Scouting app. What this app will do is write information to a text file.
 *      How this is going to be done is:
 *
 *      You will write a scouting class based on SkyStone. Keep it basic.
 *      Not too many details. This will record the things that happen during a match.
 *      Like how high a sky skraper can they build or do they park, which lane do they use, etc.
 *      Have a counter that counts how many teams have been scouted.
 *      Use every datatype you know: int, double, boolean, char, String. There is one variable that needs to be static.
 *
 *      Then, write all the information to a file. There are plenty of tutorials online about this.
 *      Make the notes useful. Don't just add the name, say "NAME: GlutenFree".
 *      There should be one write function that does all the writing to the file. This happens in a different class.
 *
 *      So one class for all the match stuff and one different to write to the file.
 *      Everything should be in one package. Make one.
 *
 *      Text me if you need hints.
