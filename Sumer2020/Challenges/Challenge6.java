    /**
    Welcome fellow cashiers

    As the person overseeing the production of the cashier app, I realised that
    here is too much code inside the main method.

    Your task for this week, should you choose to accept it, is
        1. Make a separate function/method to accept the day of the week and output if it is a working day or not [bool]
        2. If it is a working day, enter another method that will return how much discount is applicable. Do not worry about
            the extra discount for seniors
        3. Make a separate function that adds up the price for all the things that the customer buys and returns the total.
            We do not know how things many he buys.
        4. Make another function that accepts a value from one of the earlier ones and prints onto the console what
        the final price is

     Rules
         1. Have variable names that make sense
         2. Follow one convention systematically. If your brackets start on the next line as mine do, Do not change that
         3. Try to make the code as concise as possible. Not the least line numbers but logically, as simple as it can be
         4. Make the program funny or sarcastic bc why not.
