       Each level in this case will be a different program
       
       Level 1
            Accept a String from the user and display each cahracter in the string on a different line. Use the String library functions we learned
            and the appropriate loop. Use the String class documentation if you can't figure out how to. 
            
       Level 2
            Make an AAT cheating program
            Present a menu of 5 items and in the menu have these 5 things
             1. Degrees to Radians Converter: Multiply the input by pi and divide by 180
             2. Radians to Degrees Converter: Multiply the input by 180 and divide by pi 
             3. Law of Cosines Calculator given 2 sides and an angle : 1st Input squared plus second input suared minus the cosine of the angle in radians
             4. Polar to Rectangular Converter : Use Sin and Cosine to calulate the x and y coordinates
             5. Rectangular to Polar Converter : Use the pythagorean identity to calculate radius and inverse tangent to calculate the angle
             
       Level 3
            One of the converters above has a dedicated function for it. If you can figure out which one from the JAVA documentation
            for the Math class, you will reduce your work a lot.
            
         Rules are the same as alway
             0. Indent your code correctly
             1. Have variable names that make sense
             2. Follow one convention systematically. If your brackets start on the next line as mine do, Do not change that
             3. Try to make the code as concise as possible. Not the least line numbers but logically, as simple as it can be
             4. Make the program funny or sarcastic bc why not.
