/**
 *  Welcome Coders of Earth. Today you will be making another calculator. This one more advanced
 *  and better than the earlier one.
 *  
 *  Objective
 *  Level 1
 *      WAP that allows the user to add, subtract, multiply, or divide nubers infinitely until
 *      they input the 's' to stop. This will look something like this
 *      
 *      O: Welcome to Mathinator my doofenshmirtz.
 *      O: Start Calculating by entering numbers and symbols +,-,*,/,=
 *      I: 2        
 *      I: +
 *      I: 8
 *      I: *
 *      I: 2
 *      I: =
 *      O: 20
 *      
 *      Do the operations as they come. You dont have to follow PEMDAS for now. 
 *      Only the equal to sign outputs something.
 *      
 * Level 2 
 *      Include a power function. The Caret sign '^' will serve as the power operator.
 *      
 *  Rules are the same as alway
 *    0. Indent your code correctly
 *    1. Have variable names that make sense
 *    2. Follow one convention systematically. If your brackets start on the next line as mine do, Do not change that
 *    3. Try to make the code as concise as possible. Not the least line numbers but logically, as simple as it can be
 *    4. Make the program funny or sarcastic bc why not.
 *
