    // Make a Calculator
    // Output: Please enter the symbol for the operation you want to do
    // Input: +-*/ 
    // O: Enter two numbers so that we can perform this operation
    // I: 2
    // I: 2
    // O: 4
    
    // Rules
    // 0. Use atleast three different datatypes
    // 1. Have variable names that make sense
    // 2. Follow one convention systematically. If your brackets start on the next line as mine do, Do not change that
    // 3. Try to make the code as concise as possible. Not the least line numbers but logically, as simple as it can be
    
    // Concepts Tested
    // Conditional Statements, how to organize code, naming conventions, datatypes
    
    //Good Luck
